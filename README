            ConfigExamples
            --------------

The Configuration Examples are intended as an introduction to NUT
configuration for beginners.  Someone who has looked at the examples
should be able to ask comprehensible questions in the NUT mailing
list.

The files in this directory are used by LaTeX to create a PDF
file containing the NUT Configuration Examples document.

The base document is a LaTeX markup ConfigExamples.tex with two
specific style files: lineprinter.sty, and wrapfig.sty which although
featuring in the LaTeX Companion, now seems to be deprecated, so I
provide a copy.

By default the PDF is created for the A5 page size, more suitable 
for reading on-screen.

The .fig figures were created using the venerable xfig, and
exported as .pdf by xfig for inclusion in the final document.

To build the document:

   make clean && make

Latex will be run three times to ensure that all labels are 
correctly referenced.  The output is in file ConfigExamples.pdf.
