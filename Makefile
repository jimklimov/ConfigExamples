# How many times does LaTeX have to be run?  The answer is: as many
# times as are necessary to get a run with no message
#
#   LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have changed.
#   Rerun to get cross-references right.
#
# followed by another call of makeindex with the correct index
# entries, followed by a final run of LaTeX to incorporate this index
# into the document.  In other words, if the first three runs have the
# warning "Label(s) may have changed", you need five runs of LaTeX
# intermixed with four runs of makeindex.

# If you are really serious, an extra run to feed the page numbers due
# to the new index into the table of contents would be advisable, but
# wouldn't that possibly push the whole document back another page?
# Perhaps another run of LaTeX...
